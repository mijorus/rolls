A template to get started with Nextcloud app development.

## Usage

- To get started easily use the [Appstore App generator](https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/generate) to
  dynamically generate an App based on this repository with all the constants prefilled.
- Alternatively you can use the "Use this template" button on the top of this page to create a new repository based on
  this repository. Afterwards adjust all the necessary constants like App ID, namespace, descriptions etc.

Once your app is ready follow the [instructions](https://nextcloudappstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html) to
upload it to the Appstore.
